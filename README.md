Example to test https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/LiveCharts2/issues/800.

This is a working application using LiveCharts and Maui, this app was tested and published to an iOS device on the following setup:

- [LiveCharts beta.860](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LiveChartsCore/2.0.0-beta.860)
- Net 7.0, to ensure your dotnet/maui versions are updated, please ensure that your csproj file looks something [like this](https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/MauiApp-LiveCharts/blob/master/MauiApp4.csproj), (Tip: update VisualStudio 2022 to the latest stable version, this might help you when you create a new Maui project that targets dotnet 7)
- VisualStudio 2022 17.6.5
- Even if you use Windows (with Remote devices), a Mac with MacOs Ventura 13.4.
